I am an ML researcher seeking **fundamental improvements in the way we train neural networks**,
particularly **advances that compound** and **accelerate the field** as a whole.
With Recurrent Batch Normalization I improved the conditioning & optimization of RNNs.
I've also studied credit assignment and stochastic gradient estimation for RNNs.
In the past few years I've been working on social dilemmas, proposing Meta-Value Learning to enable coordination in multi-agent systems.
